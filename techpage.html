                <p>An opening or excavation in the ground for the purpose of extracting minerals; a pit or excavation
                    from which ores or other mineral substances are taken by digging; an opening in the ground made for
                    the
                    purpose of taking out minerals, and in case of coal mines, commonly a worked vein; an excavation
                    properly underground for digging out some usual product, such as ore, metal, or coal, including any
                    deposit of any material suitable for excavation and working as a placer mine; collectively, the
                    underground passage and workings and the minerals themselves.
                </p>
                <p>An excavation beneath the surface of the ground from which mineral matter of value is extracted. The
                    word carries the sense of laborers working beneath a cover of ground and thus excludes oil, brine,
                    and sulfur wells. Excavations for the extraction of ore or other economic minerals not requiring
                    work beneath the surface are designated by a modifying word or phrase as: (1) opencut mine--an
                    excavation for removing minerals that is open to the weather; (2) steam shovel mine--an opencut mine
                    in which steam shovels or other power shovels are used for loading cars; (3) strip mine--a
                    stripping; an opencut mine in which the overburden is removed from a coalbed before the coal is
                    taken out; (4) placer mine--a deposit of sand, gravel, or talus from which some valuable mineral is
                    extracted; and (5) hydraulic mine--a placer mine worked by means of a stream of water directed
                    against a bank of sand, gravel, or talus; soft rock similarly worked. A quarry from which rock is
                    extracted becomes a mine when it is carried under cover. Mines are commonly known by the mineral or
                    metal extracted such as bauxite mines, copper mines, silver mines, coal mines, etc.

                <p>mine is that ore is rock that contains utilitarian materials; primarily a rock containing metals or
                    gems which -- at the time of the rock's evaluation and proposal for extraction -- are able to be
                    separated from its neighboring minerals and processed at a cost that does not exceed those
                    materials' present-day economic values while mine is an excavation from which ore or solid minerals
                    are taken, especially one consisting of underground tunnels.

                items are dependent on
                this. Indeed the economical value of life is laid down using this. So it's pretty important to let us
                know about the life cycle of a mine to consider opening a mine. The mine through it's life will go
                through the following stages -

                <p>
                    There are four main mining methods: underground, open surface (pit), placer, and in-situ mining.

                    Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.
                    Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.
                    Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels, beach sands, or
                    other environments.
                    In-situ mining, which is primarily used in mining uranium, involves dissolving the mineral resource
                    in place then processing it at the surface without moving rock from the ground.
                    The method used depends on the type of mineral resource that is mined, its location at or beneath
                    the surface, and whether the resource is worth enough money to justify extracting it. Each mining
                    method also has varying degrees of impact on the surrounding landscape and environment.

            <div id="Environmental impacts of mining">
                <p>Mines are environmentally hazardous operations according to Swedish law. Mines can affect our
                    environment and health in different ways, primarily through the discharge of metals and other
                    substances into water, but also through noise, vibrations and dust, which can disturb people living
                    nearby. A mining operation also takes up land and changes the landscape. There are several factors
                    that steer how much the impact is from a mining operation, where the most significant factor is how
                    waste is handled. Other factors can be topography, climate, geology and the sensitivity of lakes,
                    watercourses and the water table. How much may be emitted by the operation, what noise levels,
                    vibrations or other things the operation may and may not do are regulated by the conditions set in
                    the environmental permit (see Chapter 3).</p>
                <p>The company and the supervisory authority are responsible
                    for ensuring that the conditions are complied with and that there is no harm to the environment. The
                    most significant environmental impact mines have is the discharge of metals and other substances
                    into water and the ground. The impact from the emission of metals and substances varies from
                    substance to substance. Certain substances are needed for example for the existence of life, but at
                    excessive content levels the substances can be toxic in the short-term or long-term. Acute* and
                    chronic* effects vary by substance, content and time of exposure. Metals are elements and do not
                    weather, but stay in the environment for a long time. Their mobility and capacity for dissemination
                    can however often be counteracted, among other things by raising the pH level. At a high pH level,
                    most metals are bonded in fairly insoluble compounds or adsorbed into other minerals. It is the
                    redox potential (reducing v. oxidising environment) and pH (concentration of hydrogen ions) that
                    largely governs the solubility of metals and their dissemination in the environment. This is the
                    reason why mining waste is often treated with lime, which raises the pH level. Weathering can also
                    be counteracted by creating oxygen deficient environments that prevent oxidation. Modern mine
                    operations work ongoing with decontamination of waste during operations. This is to secure the
                    environment, but also for improved profitability, since weathered material is more difficult and
                    expensive to handle. If an operation breaches the regulations of the Environmental Code the
                    supervisory authority is obliged to file a complaint.

            <div id="Alternatives to mining">
                <p>In order to lessen their impact on the environment, mining companies should look into using
                    sustainable equipment and waste disposal procedures. They should also consider replenishing the
                    local environment as often as possible, which will make the surrounding area habitable and able to
                    return to a natural state once the mine has closed. Reducing both input and output of the mining
                    process can also help to reduce the negative impact that mines have on the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Two major methods of implementing green mining reform are governmental regulation and innovative
                    technologies. Better regulation generally precedes cleaner mining practices. China's new regulations
                    for their mines are a good example of ideal government intervention with regards to the specific
                    ideas that the laws encode (enforcement has not been considered). Molycorp provides a good example
                    of the use of environmental-friendly technologies and policies in their working following the
                    reopening of the Mountain Pass site. Both of these examples have thus far proven reasonably
                    successful in terms of reducing the environmental effects of mining while suiting both business and
                    governmental motivations.

                <p>Mine reclamation is the process of restoring land that has been mined to a natural or economically
                    usable state. Although the process of mine reclamation occurs once mining is completed, the planning
                    of mine reclamation activities occurs prior to a mine being permitted or started. Mine reclamation
                    creates useful landscapes that meet a variety of goals ranging from the restoration of productive
                    ecosystems to the creation of industrial and municipal resources. In the United States, mine
                    reclamation is a regular part of modern mining practices.[1] Modern mine reclamation reduces the
                    environmental effects of mining.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mining companies sometimes overlook the importance of replenishing the environment. This simple act
                    can go a long way towards increasing the environmental sustainability of mining. There are simple
                    solutions that can be followed, such as replenishing native soils and grasses, cleaning excess
                    waste, proper waste removal, site inspections and replanting trees and natural forestry.

                    By restoring the environment around the mine, the mining companies are contributing to positive
                    environmental change, rather than making the environment more difficult to live in. The reclamation
                    process of a shut-down mine should include such steps as removing hazardous materials, reshaping the
                    land, planting native grasses or trees and restoring the topsoil.
